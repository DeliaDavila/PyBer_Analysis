# PyBer ride data analysis

## Overview of Project
This project involves analyzing ride data for PyBer, a ridesharing company.
### Purpose
This analysis was completed to review PyBer ride data. Using a sample of ride data, I organized the data into three city types: rural, urban, and suburban. The results will show different analysis that was done for these types.
### Background
This project was completed to give PyBer executives more information about how their different customers experience their brand. The data shows some discrepancy between types of area, so I will show some improvements that could be made to create a strong experience in all areas.
## Results
The analysis of the sample data provided lead to the numbers provided below. I’ll discuss the results in each section below.

### Total Rides
The majority of PyBer rides were in urban areas. The number was over twice that of suburban areas and over ten times the amount of rides in rural areas. This is not surprising, given the urban nature of ridesharing.

### Total Drivers
Urban areas had the most available drivers. While this is expected due to demand, the percentage difference of available drivers in rural and suburban areas is significantly smaller than the number of rides taken. 

### Total Sum of Fares
The overall sum of fares for each area is to be expected. However, the difference here is slightly less between areas, which denotes the higher fares.

### Average Fare per Ride
Urban riders had the lowest average fare per ride. The rural riders paid roughly ten dollars more per ride on average. 

### Average Fare per Driver
Drivers in urban areas made significantly less than drivers in rural or suburban areas. This is understandable due to competition but the numbers are the most significant difference by region.
### Comparison of Total Fare by City Type
In the chart below (also provided as a standalone figure), the total fares for a sample period are shown. This shows the much larger PyBer fare total for Urban areas. Suburban areas had a significant amount as well, but Rural areas have a significantly smaller overall PyBer presence.

## Summary
### Findings
PyBer is an urban experience for the most part. This was an expected outcome but the analysis shows that the rates of difference between the areas varied depending on what was being reviewed. The number of drivers in rural regions was lower by percentage than the amount of rides. Customers paid more for rides, but perhaps the difference relates to distance traveled as well as rate. (The data provided did not include miles or rate per mile.)
Another finding of interest is the average fare per driver. Rural drivers made a significantly higher average fare, which could be a selling point in growing the PyBer experience in rural areas.
### Recommendations
The PyBer experience has reached all types of areas, as shown by the data. But the PyBer brand awareness could be increased in suburban and rural areas. Additionally, steps could be taken to improve the experience in urban areas, possibly increasing market share in heavy competition. Some suggested changes:
* Recruit additional drivers in rural and suburban areas. The drivers average fare is larger than urban, which could be a boon to recruiting new drivers. While the overall amount of fares is currently lower, additional drivers could help these populations become aware of the brand.
* Increase driver rates in urban areas. The urban driver makes significantly less per ride. The rider pays less as well, but the rate of difference is higher for drivers in urban areas. The competition in urban areas is high, so getting and retaining good drivers will help grow the market share in an already popular area.
* Advertise in rural areas. The concept of ridesharing is popularly known as a “city” thing. This is reflected in the total amount of rides taken. While the numbers are smaller, they do exist and could likely grow. I recommend targeted advertising to communities who may either need ridesharing services or would want to become drivers.
